Companion examples repository
=============================

Planning for the ``lifecore_ros2_examples`` companion repository.

This file records planning context for the companion repository at
``apajon/lifecore_ros2_examples``.

Bootstrap status: the repository exists and the initial foundation lives on the
``bootstrap/repo-foundation`` branch. Since ``lifecore_ros2`` is published on PyPI,
the companion repository should resolve the core dependency from PyPI by default.

---

Purpose
-------

Host **applied, scenario-driven examples** that demonstrate lifecore_ros2 patterns under conditions too domain-flavored or too multi-node to belong in the core repo's ``examples/`` directory.

---

Repository identity
-------------------

- **Name**: ``lifecore_ros2_examples``
- **Owner**: ``apajon`` (same GitHub owner as ``lifecore_ros2``)
- **License**: Apache-2.0 (matches core)
- **Python / ROS baseline**: tracks the core library — Python 3.12+, ROS 2 Jazzy
- **Versioning**: independent of the core library version. The companion repo follows the core release cadence but does not pin a coupled version number.

Rejected name alternatives:

- ``lifecore_ros2_demos`` — "demos" reads as throwaway; we want examples that are followable and re-usable as scaffolding.
- ``lifecore_examples`` — drops the ``_ros2`` qualifier; risks confusion if a non-ROS variant ever exists.
- ``lifecore_ros2_recipes`` — implies a cookbook format that constrains structure prematurely.

---

Scope boundary — what belongs here vs. in core
-----------------------------------------------

An example belongs in **lifecore_ros2_examples** (companion repo) if **any** of the following is true:

1. it depends on third-party ROS packages beyond ``rclpy`` and ``std_msgs``
2. it uses domain-specific message types (``sensor_msgs``, ``geometry_msgs``, custom ``.msg``)
3. it spans more than one ROS node or launch file
4. it teaches an applied pattern (sensor fusion, supervisor, diagnostics aggregation) rather than a single core abstraction

An example belongs in **lifecore_ros2/examples/** (core repo) if **all** of the following are true:

1. it depends only on ``rclpy`` and ``std_msgs``
2. it fits in a single Python file
3. it teaches exactly one core abstraction or one lifecycle invariant
4. its expected log output can be documented in the module docstring

**Contributor exclusion test.** When in doubt, the example goes to the companion repo.

---

Example categories (initial outline)
------------------------------------

Some applied examples may take conceptual inspiration from MIT's `Underactuated Robotics`_
materials, especially when choosing dynamics, estimation, control, or robotics-system scenarios.
Those materials are inspiration for example design only; the companion repository does not vendor,
mirror, or reproduce their content.

Core examples — validated via Sprint 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These examples are **developed in the core repo first** (Sprint 4) to validate the API and detect friction early. Once proven, they move to the companion repo or inspire examples here.

- **io_gateway_node** — I/O transformation with Pub, Sub, Timer, Service + stateful processing. Teaches component coordination and gating.
- **robot_state_monitor** — Health aggregation from multiple subscribers. Teaches composition, partial failure, state queries.
- **command_gateway** — Service request validation and dispatch to client. Teaches validation hooks, error handling, async patterns.
- **minimal_supervised_node** — Multiple components with supervised error recovery. Teaches rollback, partial activation, orchestration.

Sensor-pipeline composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-publisher / multi-subscriber pipelines with a fan-in or fan-out shape.
Teaches activation gating across a topology, configure-time resource acquisition for simulated or real sensor handles, and how ``LifecycleComponent`` composition scales past the three-component pipeline already shown in the core repo.

Lifecycle-aware diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Components that publish to ``/diagnostics``, react to lifecycle transitions of *other* nodes, or aggregate health signals from sibling components. Teaches inter-component contracts, ``_on_error`` semantics, and graceful deactivation under partial failure.

Multi-node orchestration patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two or more ``LifecycleComponentNode`` processes coordinated by an external supervisor or launch file. Teaches the boundary between intra-node composition (the core library's job) and inter-node orchestration (explicitly out of scope for the core library).

---

First concrete example — sensor-fusion pipeline
-----------------------------------------------

**Working title**: ``sensor_fusion_pipeline.py`` (or split across a small package)

Topology
^^^^^^^^

- two ``LifecyclePublisherComponent`` instances simulating heterogeneous sensors (e.g. IMU-shaped at 100 Hz, GPS-shaped at 10 Hz) on distinct topics
- one fusion ``LifecycleComponent`` subscribing to both, applying a trivial weighted average, publishing the fused estimate
- one ``LifecycleSubscriberComponent`` consuming the fused topic for logging

Lifecycle teaching axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **configure**: each sensor allocates its publisher; fusion node allocates two subscriptions and one publisher; downstream subscriber allocates one subscription
- **activate**: timers start on each sensor; fusion node begins emitting only after both inputs have been observed at least once (demonstrates inbound-drop policy during the warm-up window without raising)
- **deactivate**: sensor timers stop; fusion node clears its rolling state to prevent stale-data bias on reactivation; subscriptions remain allocated
- **cleanup**: all ROS resources released; simulated sensor handles released

What it proves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- a fan-in topology with independent activation timing
- a ``LifecycleComponent`` that owns *more than two* ROS resources
- explicit handling of the "warm-up" window where one input is active but its peer has not yet delivered

Layout is provisional. The first commit will lock it.

---

Out of scope
------------

- replacing or duplicating the core regression test suite
- providing production-grade reference architectures
- packaging examples for PyPI distribution
- maintaining backward compatibility for example APIs across versions
- hosting documentation that contradicts or supersedes the core docs

---

Coupling to core releases
--------------------------

- the companion repo depends on the published ``lifecore_ros2`` package by default
- local editable overrides remain a developer workflow for testing examples against unreleased core changes
- breaking core API changes update the pin; the companion repo does **not** gate core releases
- the core repo's release process never blocks on companion-repo state

---

Implementation phases
---------------------

Validation phase (Sprint 4 in core repo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the companion repo exists, core examples are validated in the core `examples/` directory:

- Core examples are simple but real: io_gateway_node, command_gateway, etc.
- They validate the API and reveal friction
- They guide the design of future sprints (S5–S10)
- Once proven, they can be ported or extended in the companion repo

Phase 0 — Repository bootstrap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [x] Create ``apajon/lifecore_ros2_examples`` on GitHub
- [x] Add ``LICENSE`` (Apache-2.0)
- [x] Add ``README.md`` with positioning, scope boundary, install, and link back to core
- [x] Add ``pyproject.toml``: Python 3.12+, local editable ``lifecore_ros2`` source, dev extras (ruff, pyright, pytest)
- [x] Add ``.gitignore``, ``.editorconfig``, ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` aligned with core
- [x] Add a manual-only quality workflow (``workflow_dispatch``; no broad ``push`` trigger)

Phase 1 — First applied example: sensor-fusion pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Context.** Core examples (Sprint 4) are validated in the core repo. This phase extends them with domain-specific, multi-node, or complex scenarios that belong in the companion repo.

First example focuses on **sensor-fusion pipeline** — fan-in multi-sensor integration:
- [ ] Two simulated heterogeneous sensors as ``LifecyclePublisherComponent`` instances
- [ ] Fusion ``LifecycleComponent`` with two subscriptions and one publisher
- [ ] Downstream ``LifecycleSubscriberComponent`` for logging
- [ ] Module docstring with teaching axis, CLI commands, expected log output
- [ ] Demonstrate the warm-up window with explicit inbound-drop behavior
- [ ] Demonstrate state reset on deactivate (rolling-average buffer cleared)
- [ ] Add ``examples/sensor_fusion/README.md`` explaining the topology

Phase 2 — Quality gates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [x] CI workflow: ``ruff check``, ``ruff format --check``, ``pyright``, ``pytest``
- [ ] Smoke test that imports each example module without invoking ``rclpy.spin``
- [x] Document validation commands in the repo ``README.md``
- [ ] Confirm install-from-scratch on a clean ROS 2 Jazzy environment

Phase 3 — Signposting back to core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [ ] Update ``lifecore_ros2/README.md`` to link to the live companion repo URL
- [ ] Update ``lifecore_ros2/docs/examples.rst`` to link to the live companion repo URL
- [ ] Move planning artifacts from core repo into the companion repo
- [ ] Update ``lifecore_ros2/ROADMAP.md`` to mark the companion repo as published

Phase 4 — Second example (post-Phase-3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- [ ] Choose between *lifecycle-aware diagnostics* and *multi-node orchestration* based on user feedback
- [ ] Apply the same module-docstring discipline (one teaching axis, expected output)
- [ ] Avoid expanding into a domain framework — each example remains followable in isolation

---

Non-goals
---------

Do not add to this list:

- a regression test suite mirroring the core repo
- production-grade reference architectures
- a PyPI package
- documentation that supersedes the core docs
- backward-compatibility guarantees for example APIs across versions
